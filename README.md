## dash-dot

[![Test Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pahoughton/...png)](https://travis-ci.org/pahoughton/..)

itterative poc for automation of the scaling, administration and
mantenance of functionallity.

when the dot is not pretty, you dash off too learn why and what you
can do to beautify the dot.

end game? elimination of repetition through iterative validation
(D.R.Y.).

## Validation

./prove-it

## Features

Open Source first ...

Single entry point (url) for application, system and hardware status
with built in research paths.

First url is the dot which a visual artist will be able to provide a
quick view with details becomeing more obvious the more you look (ok a
BIG CIRCLE, not a dot :).

The dash is what happens next. Respond to the dot and it will expand
to more detail releative to who you are (w/ opts).

as the images provide the research path and ongoing status, the are
watching your progress, time to action, actions taken through
closure.  We live we Learn :). When everyone's responce to the dot is
to smile and stop looking, we get to play with then next toy

Every imperfection generates and assigns a ticket. closed tickets
include proactive steps to automate everything, excluding the user
decision steps.

First cut, Grafana will generate the dot and all other images.

## Use Cases

from an engineers perspective ...

What changed? Unanticipated load? material or communications failure?

Most common answer will be an unanticipated use case, hence no
validation of the automated responce to the event.

Provide complete relative details for imperfections with responce time
relative to age and utilization.

DELETE DELETE (delete nothing ... yet)

As we move to more self iterating processes and less expensive
retention, most all data becomes useful in one way or another.

Nextiva provides an improving experience.











blown
off, the better the system is working.
